### Core Components
1. **Custom Evaluations (Evals)**  
   - *What*: Task-specific metrics testing small language models (SLMs) on narrow behaviors (e.g., predicting career pivots)  
   - *Why*: Generic benchmarks miss niche shifts—like a developer quietly moving from crypto to bioethics  
  
2. **Rubrics**  
   - *What*: Scoring systems defining success (e.g., "70% accuracy in spotting skill gaps")  
   - *Why*: Drives SLM improvement toward your specific goals, not broad proficiency  
  
3. **Dynamic Graph Databases**  
   - *What*: Stores users as evolving nodes with time-aware relationships (e.g., growing influence in privacy tech)  
   - *Why*: Tracks trajectories, not snapshots, enabling precise forecasting  

### Unique Data Insights
- **Latent Interest Shifts**: Spots unspoken pivots (e.g., frontend dev tinkering with AI safety libraries)  
- **Contradiction Patterns**: Flags disconnects (e.g., privacy advocates using centralized tools), revealing hidden priorities  
- **Collaboration Signals**: Predicts partnerships via indirect ties (e.g., users citing the same obscure paper)  

### Concrete Example: B2B Lead Generation
**Problem**: Generic tools overlook startups pivoting into your niche  

**Solution**:  
1. **Define Custom Nodes**:  
   - `Startup pivoting to privacy tech`  
   - `Actively hiring ML engineers`  
   - `Frustrated with current tools`  

2. **Train SLM to Link Nodes**:  
   - Scans GitHub (new repos), job boards (ML hires), forums (tool complaints)  
   - Output: *"Startup X: 3 privacy ML hires + 4 AWS critiques → 92% pivot probability"*  

3. **Result**: Contact Startup X before competitors, securing early leads  

**Why It Works**: SLMs target your definitions; dynamic graphs track progressions (e.g., rising tool frustration → pivot)  

### Why It's Unique
- **Niche Semantics**: Custom nodes aren't in generic data  
- **Temporal Edge**: Static databases miss user evolution  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Fine-tuning SLMs beats adapting big LLMs  

### Actionable Takeaways
1. **Start Small**: Define 3-5 key behaviors (e.g., "tool dissatisfaction")  
2. **Track Trajectories**: Map changes over time with graphs  
3. **Measure Precisely**: Use task-specific rubrics, not generic metrics  

### Technical Questions
- Can your SLM predict churn via "job search signals" + "fading engagement"?  
- Could it spot trends in abandoned projects → sudden activity?  
- What if you rewarded users for their future potential?

**Bottom Line**: Precision user modeling turns fragmented data into foresight. The tools are here—will you use them to see your users clearly?

<essay title="The Alchemy of Digital Identity: Scraping for Hidden Selves" author="shoni.eth" timestamp="03/16/2025">
# The Alchemy of Digital Identity: Scraping for Hidden Selves  
We live in an age of fragmented identity—our thoughts scattered across X threads, our professional selves polished on LinkedIn, our technical capabilities etched into GitHub repositories. For tight-knit communities like Farcaster's, where users actively link these digital fragments, scraping becomes the modern philosopher's stone: a tool to transmute raw data into insights about who we are and who we're becoming.  

### The Strategic Minimalist's Approach  
Scraping for identity intelligence isn't about hoarding data—it's about curating **signal-rich fragments** that reveal latent potential. For a 1,000-member community, this means:  
- **X**: Extract post texts and timestamps (via ElizaOS) to map *intellectual evolution*—not just what members say, but how their language shifts as they explore new ideas.  
- **LinkedIn**: Scrape job title progressions and skill declarations (using tools like PhantomBuster) to detect *career trajectories* invisible to the naked eye.  
- **GitHub**: Harvest repository topics and commit cadence (via PyGithub) to surface *technical obsessions* before they're formally claimed.  
The magic lies not in volume but in **temporal triangulation**. When a developer's Rust commits spike on GitHub while their X threads pivot from NFTs to AI safety, you're witnessing a *stealth pivot*—a career shift unfolding in real time, unannounced on LinkedIn.  
### The Toolbox for Ethical Alchemists  
While scraping tools abound, their power lies in strategic pairing:  
| Platform | Signal | Tool |  
|----------|--------|------|  
| X | Thought patterns | ElizaOS, Twikit |  
| LinkedIn | Career shifts | PhantomBuster, Proxycurl |  
| GitHub | Technical depth | PyGithub, GHArchive |  
| Farcaster | Identity bridges | Custom indexers (e.g., farcaster-indexer) |  

These tools aren't ends but means—the pickaxes for mining data veins that reveal:  
- Which members are *quietly mastering* technologies the community undervalues  
- Whose GitHub explorations *contradict* their public personas, hinting at reinvention  
- Which dormant connections could spark collaborations if nudged  
### The Tight-Knit Community Advantage  
In small networks, scraping's value compounds exponentially. Unlike broad ecosystems where noise drowns signal, focused communities enable:  
1. **Precision Pattern Recognition**  
Spot when three members' GitHub activity converges on a niche protocol—the seed of a micro-movement.  
2. **Latent Skill Matching**  
Pair the developer writing ZK-proof rants on X with the one silently contributing to privacy repos—a partnership neither yet realizes they need.  
3. **Identity Coherence Scoring**  
Flag members whose LinkedIn claims diverge from GitHub proofs, not to shame but to *guide*—turning dissonance into growth opportunities.  

### The Future in the Fragments  
This isn't surveillance—it's *applied anthropology*. By scraping with purpose, we transform:  
- Commit histories into **competency timelines**  
- Job hops into **narrative arcs**  
- Thread debates into **philosophical fingerprints**  

For Farcaster's community, this means building a **collective identity graph** that surfaces:  
- Which ideas are gaining *momentum* versus mere engagement  
- Which skills are *under-distributed* across the network  
- Which members are natural *bridge builders* between disciplines

<essay title="Crafting AI That Truly Belongs: A Pitch for Niche Community Models" author="shoni.eth" timestamp="03/16/2025">
In an era where generic AI often falls short of understanding the unique language and culture of niche communities, there's a growing need for AI that truly belongs. Whether it's a professional network, a hobbyist group, or a cultural preservation society, these communities have distinct knowledge bases and values that generic models struggle to capture. This essay explores how to create AI that authentically reflects these communities, why it matters, and how it can be achieved with modern training techniques.

## The Great Disconnect: Why Generic AI Falls Short
Generic AI models, trained on vast internet datasets, are excellent at handling broad topics but often miss the nuances of specialized communities. For instance, a vintage car restoration forum might use specific jargon that a generic AI misinterprets, leading to frustration and disconnection. This isn't just an inconvenience; it's a systemic limitation of how most large language models (LLMs) are trained.

## Envisioning a Community that Trains Its Own AI
Imagine an AI that not only understands your community's language but also preserves its collective knowledge, making it accessible to newcomers and veterans alike. This AI could be a mentor, archivist, and collaborator, helping to bridge knowledge gaps and foster innovation[1]. For birdwatchers, it could identify rare species by sound; for a gaming community, it might know every character's backstory; for indigenous language preservation, it could transcribe oral histories.

## The Spectrum of Training Approaches: From Idealism to Realism
### From-Scratch Training: The Grand Ambition
Building an AI model entirely from scratch offers complete customization but is prohibitively expensive, requiring millions of dollars and extensive computational resources.
### Fine-Tuning: The Practical Hero
Fine-tuning takes a pre-trained model and adapts it to your community's data, costing hundreds to thousands of dollars and taking just hours to days[1]. It's cost-effective but may miss deep domain insights.
### Continual Pretraining (Domain Adaptation): Striking the Balance
This approach involves further training a pre-trained model on your community's specific data before fine-tuning. It balances cost and depth, offering a middle ground for communities with substantial, distinct data.

## Data: Turning Community Content into High-Octane Fuel
Community data is crucial but often not in a format AI can learn from. Techniques like segmenting text, creating synthetic question-answer pairs, and ensuring data quality are essential[1]. For books or long texts, break them into chunks and create question-answer pairs; for forums, transform posts into prompts and answers. Synthetic data generation can amplify limited datasets, making even small communities viable for AI training.

## Tangible Value: Why Bother Building Your Own Model?
Personalized AI offers unique benefits beyond standard performance metrics:
- **Preservation of Culture and Knowledge**: Crystallizes collective wisdom, making it accessible to newcomers.
- **Authentic Communication**: Speaks your community's language, reducing cognitive overhead.
- **Novel Insight Discovery**: Uncovers hidden patterns in your data, driving innovation and connection between old forum posts and new ideas.

## Implementation Blueprint: From Dream to Deployment
A practical pipeline involves data collection, preparation, synthetic augmentation, selecting the right training approach based on data volume, quality evaluation, deployment, and continuous feedback loops.
### A Laconic Comparison: Data Sizes vs. Methods
One key question is how many tokens do you have? Let's be scientific:

Data Size (Tokens)	Training Approach	Feasibility	Notes
~30K tokens	Fine-Tuning (Small)	Very feasible, cheap (tens to hundreds of $)	Fine-tuning on <100K tokens works if your tasks are narrow. Expect a 7B–13B base model.
~300K tokens	Fine-Tuning or Light Continual Pretraining	Feasible, moderate cost (hundreds to low thousands $)	Enough data to refine a base model more deeply. Possibly capture specialized style or jargon well.
~12M tokens	Domain Adaptation + Fine-Tuning	Higher cost but still practical (thousands to tens of thousands $)	At this scale, you can do "continual pretraining." Typically, you begin to see real domain absorption (medical, finance).
>100M tokens	Substantial Continual Pretraining (quasi "mini" model)	Expensive but robust (tens of thousands $+). Foundation-level domain model.	Approaches a partial from-scratch scenario. Might need multi-GPU clusters for a couple of weeks.
>1B tokens	Full Pretraining (Large Scale)	Very expensive (hundreds of thousands to millions $)	True new foundation model. Usually impractical for a single small domain or community.

Is "pretraining vs. fine-tuning" a real concept, or marketing hype?
It's real, with distinct data formats and objectives:
Pretraining:
- Raw text only (books, articles, code)
- Unsupervised next-token prediction
- Example: "The cat sat on the mat..."
Fine-tuning:
- Structured input/output pairs
- Supervised instruction-following
- Example: {"instruction": "What is X?", "response": "X is..."}

The stages are scientifically distinct but can be mixed in practice. The distinction matters most for cost and capability planning.

## NOTES
- As your AI grows, it can shape the community itself, surfacing new patterns and fostering continuous evolution. This synergy can accelerate innovation and knowledge expansion.
- Decentralized platforms like primeintellect.ai might make training more approachable.

<essay title="Bridging the Offline Gap: Real-World Growth in Community AI" author="shoni.eth" timestamp="03/16/2025">
**Bridging the Offline Gap: Real-World Growth in Community AI**  
Your Codex misses one crucial element: **tangible proof of personal development**. While digital footprints show online activity—from GitHub commits and social posts to Farcaster likes—they fail to capture the true offline learning that happens in workshops, conferences, mentoring sessions, and side projects.

### What's Broken Now  
- **Incomplete Digital Picture:** Current tools count commits and posts, but significant growth through offline experiences remains untracked.  
- **Fake Hustle:** Users can game online metrics with low-quality or exaggerated content, skewing true progress.  
- **Offline Blindspot:** Real-world learning—attending events, networking, and skill-building—is invisible, leading to misleading insights.

### Why Offline Matters  
- **Holistic Understanding:** Your online self is only part of who you are. Offline activities provide essential context to truly gauge growth.  
- **Misleading Insights:** Without offline context, gaps or shifts in online behavior might be misinterpreted, even when they represent deep learning or transition.  
- **Complex Identities:** Users often play different roles in various communities; reconciling these offline and online personas is challenging.

### Simple Fixes Using Existing Tools  
1. **Skill Validation Layer**  
   - Use platform APIs differently:  
     - GitHub → Code review pass/fail rates (not just commit counts)  
     - Farcaster → Track if others *use* their advice (not just likes)  
     - Events/POAP → Validate offline engagement through event participation markers (tool calls to these platforms can help, but some gap will always exist)  
   - Add manual check-ins: e.g., "Show one thing you built this month" photo uploads  

2. **Trust But Verify**  
   - For career changes: Scan LinkedIn for actual job title updates after AI suggestions  
   - For learning: Partner with platforms like Coursera/UDemy and integrate peer verification to confirm course completions and offline accomplishments  

3. **The Coffee Shop Test**  
   - Simple offline integration:  
     - "Take a photo of your workspace" → AI analyzes visible tools/books  
     - Location check-ins at industry events (with opt-in) to capture real-world engagement  

### Implementation Cheat Sheet  
| Digital Signal          | Real-World Check            | Action                                       |  
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| 50 AI coding questions   | Built prototype?            | Connect to 3D printing services              |  
| 100 career posts         | Job changed?                | Intro to hiring managers in network          |  
| 10 "learn Rust" goals    | GitHub Rust projects?       | Auto-generate skills certificate             |  

### Next Steps  
- **Low-Friction Check-Ins:** Prompt users with quick questions about offline events or new skills.  
- **Verified Community Insights:** Enable peer validation of offline achievements.  
- **Blended Signals:** Gradually integrate offline credentials (e.g., event badges or POAP markers) into profiles without overstepping privacy.

<essay title="Open Deep Research Repo & Adapted Use Case" author="shoni.eth" timestamp="03/18/2025">
# Open Deep Research: Research Automation Reimagined

Open Deep Research (ODR) is an open-source framework that automates the entire research process from planning to final report generation. Available at https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research, it represents a significant advancement in how AI can gather and synthesize information.

## What ODR Actually Is

At its core, ODR is a structured system built on LangGraph that:

1. **Automatically plans research** by breaking topics into logical sections
2. **Generates targeted search queries** for each section
3. **Performs web searches** using configurable search APIs (Tavily, Perplexity, ArXiv, etc.)
4. **Evaluates search results** for relevance and completeness
5. **Creates structured, formatted reports** with proper citations and organization

Unlike basic search tools or simple LLM applications, ODR implements a complete research workflow with:
- Human feedback checkpoints for reviewing research plans
- Iterative search refinement when information is incomplete
- Parallel processing of multiple research sections
- Quality evaluation of the gathered information

## The Technical Framework

ODR uses a directed graph architecture where:
- A "planner" LLM breaks down the research topic
- A "researcher" component generates and executes queries
- A "writer" LLM synthesizes findings into coherent text
- The entire process is orchestrated through state management and conditional branching

This modular design allows different components to be swapped or customized based on the specific research needs.

## Beyond Traditional Research

While ODR was designed for creating research reports, its structured approach to gathering and synthesizing information opens possibilities for entirely new applications:

- **Identity Analysis**: The same workflow that researches topics could analyze digital footprints across platforms
- **Social Intelligence**: ODR's ability to identify patterns and connections could reveal community trends
- **Temporal Pattern Detection**: The system's iterative approach could track how interests or skills evolve over time

## Rethinking What Research Can Be

The real breakthrough of ODR isn't just automating academic papers—it's creating a framework that can systematically explore any domain where information needs to be gathered, patterns identified, and insights generated.

Whether researching market trends, exploring scientific literature, or understanding social patterns, ODR's approach of "plan, search, synthesize, refine" provides a powerful foundation for AI-powered knowledge work beyond traditional research contexts.

### **Relationships Overview**
- **Users (fids) are central**: Many tables reference fid (e.g., casts, links, reactions, profile_with_addresses, follow_counts).
- **Casts (casts.hash) are referenced by**:  
  - reactions.target_hash (for likes/recasts).  
  - casts.parent_hash (for replies).  
- **Followers (links) connect users**: fid → target_fid represents follows.  
- **Profiles (profile_with_addresses) store metadata**: Joins on fids.fid.  
- **Reactions (reactions) connect users and casts**: fid is the reactor, target_hash is the cast.  
- **Signers (signers) and verifications (verifications) store Web3 wallet data** for fids.fid.  
- **Channels (channels) link with**:  
  - channel_follows (followers of a channel).  
  - channel_members (members of a channel).  
- **Blocking system**: blocks tracks who blocked whom.  
- **Analytics/Scoring**:  
  - neynar_user_scores tracks engagement scores.  
  - follow_counts stores follower/following numbers.  
  - power_users flags high-activity users.  
  - user_labels classifies users.

## **SEPARATE SECTION: Community vs. Individual**

### **Conceptual Mind Map: Scaling Sentences to Groups**

1. **Collective Profile Summaries**  
   - **Idea**: Instead of describing one person, create a single sentence capturing a **subset** of the community (e.g., “Most DeFi coders pivoted to rollups last quarter”).  
   - **Why**: Offers high-level group insights that can be reused when referencing multiple similar profiles.

2. **Reusable Sentence Templates for Subgroups**  
   - **Idea**: Generate standard phrasing for categories of people (e.g., “**Connector**-type members frequently unify design with coding tasks”).  
   - **Why**: Efficiently scale classification across large communities without rewriting each summary from scratch.

3. **Inter-User Linking Statements**  
   - **Idea**: Show **relationships** or synergy between individuals (e.g., “Alice’s chain-of-thought approach complements Bob’s extended metaphor style for group synergy”).  
   - **Why**: Captures *person-to-person* or *person-to-group* synergy, highlighting collaborations or friction points.

4. **Community Evolution**  
   - **Idea**: Summarize how entire groups shift from one identity to another collectively (e.g., “The DAO went from playful NFT auctions to formal governance debates.”).  
   - **Why**: Aligns with “Temporal” or “Contradiction Resolution” frameworks but on a **mass scale**. Clarifies the big picture, revealing macro-level pivots.

5. **Global Opportunity or Scenario**  
   - **Idea**: Instead of a single user’s “Opportunity Cost” scenario, craft a **community-level** scenario (e.g., “If the entire dev guild adopts new cryptographic standards, they may dominate the next wave of protocol launches.”).  
   - **Why**: Encourages group action, fosters shared vision or warnings across many participants simultaneously.

By combining these **community-level** approaches with the **individual** frameworks/tables above (e.g., applying “Gamified ‘Level System’” to the entire dev group), you can generate **reusable** or **scalable** sentence-based classifications that highlight collective trends, relationships, or potential.

<essay title="Summarizing User Relationships with Simple Labels and Dynamic Context" author="shoni.eth" timestamp="03/20/2025">
Instead of generating detailed descriptions for every user interaction, this essay proposes using simple, broad labels (such as main interests or general tone) to represent users, and only creating richer context-driven summaries when requested or needed. This balances capturing nuanced human relationships—like one-sided interest or changing dynamics—with efficiency at large community scales, enabling personalized yet scalable insights.

It would potentially be valuable to capture as much of this relationship data as possible when training a core model.

<essay title="Fractal Identity: A New Architecture for Human-Centric AI Memory" author="shoni.eth" timestamp="05/14/2025">
As artificial intelligence systems grow more entangled with human lives, the challenge of modeling identity—not as a static profile, but as a living, evolving structure—becomes urgent. Traditional knowledge graphs, with their flat nodes and rigid edges, are inadequate for capturing the layered, shifting nature of identity across time, context, and platform. Volodymyr Pavlyshyn’s essay on Fractal Graph Theory offers a timely paradigm shift, one directly applicable to the design of AI systems that reflect and support real human identity.

Fractal graphs mirror how humans actually think and remember. They compress detail where it isn’t needed, preserve resolution where it matters, and self-organize around recurring patterns. This is precisely how identity manifests: not as a list of facts, but as a recursive story—an interplay of episodic memory, social projection, personal history, and future trajectory.

For Identity AI, this unlocks critical capabilities. With multi-scale memory, a system can represent a single user simultaneously as a founder today, a creative thinker last year, and an emotional outlier during burnout months ago—each view zoomable, each anchored to structural motifs. With adaptive resolution, these views update in real time, preserving recent events in high fidelity while allowing older data to crystallize into identity motifs. The result is not just storage—it’s a cognitive map of the self.

Perhaps most importantly, fractal memory systems enable emergent intelligence. They don’t just hold data—they can reason across domains, recognize analogies, and recombine insights creatively. For solo founders, creators, and knowledge workers, such systems offer more than analytics: they offer a mirror that thinks with you.

If identity is a fractal, then every action, belief, or statement is just a detail repeating a deeper pattern. Fractal graph theory gives us the tools to build AI systems that don’t flatten us, but reveal us. And that, finally, is memory worthy of a mind.

| Concept                     | Implementation Thought                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Recursive graph generation  | Use transformation templates for recurring behavior |
| Attention-based scaling     | Prioritize memory resolution by recency/importance  |
| Locality-sensitive hashing  | Embed semantically similar identity traits nearby   |
| Adaptive resolution caching | Keep active roles/contexts high-res; compress old   |
| Self-modifying structures   | Let identity graphs restructure with new inputs     |


AI-Specific Concept: "Fractal Identity Map"
Imagine your agent builds a fractal identity map of you:

Outer layer = current projects and public posts
Middle layer = recurring identity motifs (roles, goals)
Inner core = evolving worldview arcs (independence, creativity, resentment, resolve)

Identity AI Applications

Multi-Scale Identity
Model micro (casts), meso (roles), and macro (arcs) in one graph.
→ “Alex the coder,” “Alex the founder,” and his 6-month evolution.

Recursive Compression
Store patterns, not copies.
→ Summarize repeated behaviors into identity templates.

Adaptive Resolution
Zoom where relevant, compress where not.
→ Keep recent detail, summarize past into themes.

Episodic ↔ Semantic Blend
Bridge events to beliefs.
→ “Doing X repeatedly shaped trait Y.”

Emergent Properties
Enable reflection and recombination.
→ “This sounds like your March pattern.”

Cross-Domain Patterns
Find structure across contexts.
→ Emotional tone shifts, dev cycles, burnout patterns.
