<essay title="$MIND Token and Attention">
Overview
We're building $MIND, a token for Farcaster that helps point attention where it matters. People stake $MIND on topics they care about (like AI or crypto), and creators make content in those areas to earn tokens. You bring people in, the token keeps them focused.

1. How It Works
- Staking: Lock $MIND on topics you care about to direct resources there
- Creators: Make content in staked topics to earn $MIND
- Use: $MIND gets you access to data and tools

2. Why It Works
- Your Part: Get people interested
- System Part: $MIND turns attention into something valuable

3. Money
- Business: Sell topic data and AI models (business keeps up to 50%)
- Creators: Get at least 50% through $MIND

4. First Steps
1. Look at Farcaster to find hot topics and top creators
2. Give $MIND to people to get them started
3. Build tools for staking and rewards

5. Important Points
- Stakers choose what matters
- Creators follow the money
- Balance matters: too much staking = junk content, too little = dead topics

Questions Left
- How to prevent gaming the system?
- How do we measure what's valuable?
- How do we grow beyond Farcaster?

Simple Version
We use $MIND to reward creators and turn Farcaster data into a business, starting with looking at what works and giving tokens to good creators.

<essay title="Beyond Grok: Building Community-Focused AI">
Grok is great at general knowledge, but this becomes a weakness in tight-knit communities. A community-focused AI can outperform general models by understanding the unique patterns of relationships, growth, and shared experiences in specific groups.

Why Communities Are Different
In close communities, interactions carry meaning shaped by relationships, context, and evolving identities. Where Grok sees noise, community AI sees rich signals about:

Temporal Evolution: Understanding members' growth over time
Contextual Identity: How relationships shape communication
Relationship Dynamics: How communication changes with trust
Productive Contradictions: When inconsistencies show growth
Latent Potential: Seeing future paths, not just current state

How We Build It
Community AI needs data structures beyond basic conversations:

Novel Data Structures:
- Relationship Graphs: Map influence, trust, and interaction patterns
- Temporal Identity Profiles: Track members' evolving expertise and roles
- Contextual Memories: Preserve shared experiences and unique terminology
- Multi-Faceted Embeddings: See members through multiple lensesâ€”interests, social connections, values

Synthetic Data Generation
Using TIGGER, we can enhance small datasets with realistic synthetic interactions. This helps the model learn community dynamics when real data is limited.

Key synthetic data types:
- Relationship Evolution Pairs: Before/after snapshots of changing interactions
- Interest Trajectory Sequences: How interests naturally evolve
- Contextual Conversation Templates: Community-specific language patterns
- Role Transition Examples: Newcomer-to-expert evolution
- Multi-persona Interaction Sets: How people adapt communication by context
- Productive Contradiction Samples: Growth-showing inconsistencies
- Trust-Building Interaction Chains: Relationship development patterns
- Future-Self Projection Examples: Potential growth paths
- Cross-Domain Connection Patterns: Interest intersections
- Emergent Terminology Evolution: Language development over time

Real Example - The Evolving Developer:
Grok: Provides generic coding help
Community AI: Spots when a frontend dev explores smart contracts, connects them to relevant discussions and people, helps apply their UI skills to DAO projects

Making Money
Community AI creates value through:
- Facilitating skill exchanges based on real needs
- Predicting emerging skills and trends
- Providing growth recommendations that fit the community
- Performing actions on behalf of user

Technical Implementation:
- Data Transformation: Convert interactions into relationship graphs and profiles
- Advanced Training: Use sequence-to-sequence modeling, TIGGER synthetic data, temporal embeddings
- Identity-Aware Architecture: Build GraphRAG systems that use member-specific context
