  <Vision>
    Build AI that helps people discover and achieve their potential by analyzing their digital footprint over time.
  </Vision>

  <Friction>
    - Generic AI models miss community context and language
    - Current tools focus on short-term metrics instead of long-term growth
    - User data scattered across multiple platforms
    - Users distrust AI handling personal data
    - Building specialized AI models is expensive
  </Friction>

  <Leverage>
    - Access to user data across Farcaster, GitHub, and X
    - Small communities provide focused testing ground
    - $MIND token incentivizes quality content
    - Can generate training data from small datasets
    - Privacy tools available for user data protection
  </Leverage>

  <Mechanics>
    - Track user activity and interests over time
    - Measure specific behaviors in each community
    - Combine data from multiple platforms
    - Train AI on community-specific language
    - Use tokens to reward helpful contributions
  </Mechanics>

  <NextMoves>
    - Build data collection from platforms
    - Create basic user activity visualization
    - Define metrics for tracking career changes
    - Watch how community responds
  </NextMoves>

  <Whispers>
    - Will AI predictions influence people's choices?
    - Some people change careers suddenly rather than gradually
    - How do we handle users active in multiple communities?
    - Can AI tell the difference between growth and inconsistency?
  </Whispers>

  <RecursiveMultiplier>
    - Update AI based on observed user changes
    - Adjust metrics based on community feedback
    - Improve training data generation
    - Modify token rewards based on what works
    - Update template based on what we learn
