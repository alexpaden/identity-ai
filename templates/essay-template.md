## One-Line Distillation Workflow

After completing your ESSAY_CODEX, follow this process to create your one-line pitch:

1. **Extract Core Elements**
   - Hook → Key attention grabber
   - Thesis → Central claim
   - Resonance → Lasting impact
   
2. **Apply Compression Formula**
   ```
   [Key Innovation] + [Transformation] = [Why It Matters]
   ```

3. **Refinement Rules**
   - Maximum 20 words
   - Must include both action and impact
   - Avoid jargon unless essential
   - Focus on transformation

4. **Validation Check**
   - Could someone repeat this to others?
   - Does it capture the essay's essence?
   - Would it make sense outside full context?

Example Process:
Hook: "AI evolves from digital mirror to future-self catalyst"
Thesis: "Temporal knowledge graphs reveal hidden potential in community dynamics"
Resonance: "AI becomes active guide in human transformation"
↓
Formula Application: [AI Evolution] + [Community Intelligence] = [Human Potential Impact]
↓
One-Line: "Good business opportunity in AI and Identity which can be applied to community (governance) or individual (understanding)."
