# Founder's Evolving Codex

<!-- 
  NOTE TO AI:
  You will receive founder thinking patterns to transform into a recursive knowledge system.
  Your task is to create ONE cohesive `main.md` following the structure below,
  incorporating compounding insight principles while focusing on velocity, leverage,
  and adaptive thinking. DO NOT output these instructions in the final text.

====================================
   RECURSIVE STRUCTURE:
====================================
Output must be wrapped in these self-modifying tags:

<CODEX>
  <Vision>
    <!-- Core directional thesis (1 line max) -->
  </Vision>

  <Friction>
    <!-- Active pain points in current thinking patterns -->
  </Friction>

  <Leverage>
    <!-- Force multipliers already available but underutilized -->
  </Leverage>

  <Mechanics>
    <!-- How the system actually compounds insights -->
  </Mechanics>

  <NextMoves>
    <!-- Immediate executable actions - 'none' valid -->
  </NextMoves>

  <Whispers>
    <!-- Half-formed intuitions and idea fragments -->
  </Whispers>

  <RecursiveMultiplier>
    <!-- Weekly synthesis that modifies the template itself. Suggested edits to this template producing the document -->
  </RecursiveMultiplier>

  <OneThingNotIncluded>
    <!--  Critical Blind Spot Detection  -->

    <!-- Critical blind spot in current system design -->

    <!-- Critical blind spot in current data analytics -->

    <!-- Critical blind spot in current product approach -->

    <!-- Critical blind spot in current project philosophy -->
  </OneThingNotIncluded>
</CODEX>

====================================
   FOUNDER PRINCIPLES:
====================================

1) VELOCITY OVER POLISH:
   - Capture thoughts in raw XML-like format without overstructuring
   - Favor 3 bullet points over 3 paragraphs
   - Update the template weekly based on what actually generated insight
   - Reference other.md for additional emerging ideas and patterns

2) COMPOUNDING MECHANICS:
   - Daily: Brutally simple capture (90 seconds max per entry)
   - Weekly: Cluster related friction/leverage points
   - Monthly: Prune ineffective template sections
   - Cross-reference with other.md for pattern validation

3) NONLINEAR THINKING:
   - Track idea half-life (mark expiration dates on insights)
   - Preserve whispers in dedicated container
   - Allow moves = 'none' when in observation mode

4) ANTIFRAGILE FEEDBACK:
   - Let system break before your company does
   - Stress-test blind spots weekly
   - Automate pattern detection (simple scripts over manual analysis)

====================================
   FINAL OUTPUT ONLY:
====================================
The system must auto-modify through use:

<CODEX>
  <Vision> ... </Vision>
  <Friction> ... </Friction>
  <Leverage> ... </Leverage>
  <Mechanics> ... </Mechanics>
  <NextMoves> ... </NextMoves>
  <Whispers> ... </Whispers>
  <RecursiveMultiplier> ... </RecursiveMultiplier>
  <OneThingNotIncluded> ... </OneThingNotIncluded>
</CODEX>

  FINAL NOTE: This template intentionally leaves gaps - 
  the missing pieces are where your unique insights live.
  The structure will fight you until you make it yours.
