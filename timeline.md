Direct Answer
Given your work on generating summaries and embeddings for threads on Farcaster, the best next steps are to build a prototype tool that provides users with insights into their thread participation and interest evolution. This could help validate your ideas for a potential startup or research project.
Building a Prototype
Start by creating a simple web app or bot that analyzes a user's Farcaster thread data. Use your existing summaries and embeddings to show how their interests have changed over time and suggest new topics or skills to explore. This can help users see their personal growth and could be shared on Farcaster or X to gather feedback.
Exploring Opportunities
Consider offering your thread embeddings and summaries as a data product via an API, which other developers might use for building applications. This could open up collaboration and monetization opportunities. If you're interested in research, document your methods for potential academic publications in fields like social computing.
Gathering Feedback and Iterating
Share your prototype with the Farcaster community to see what features users value most. Use this feedback to refine your tool, potentially turning it into a startup focused on AI coaching or identity evolution, or a research project exploring new AI models for personal growth.
