# What's Missing

The Mirror of Becoming has a critical blind spot: **User Feedback Integration Mechanisms**. While the system impressively maps identity evolution through data analysis, it lacks structured ways to incorporate explicit user input on its predictions and recommendations.

## Why It Matters

When AI systems make predictions about someone's identity or potential future, they need clear feedback channels so users can correct, refine, or redirect these projections. Without this:

- Users feel analyzed but not heard, creating a one-way relationship
- The system misses critical context only the user knows (internal motivations, offline activities)
- Identity projections drift from user intentions, reducing trust and perceived value
- The system's learning becomes increasingly disconnected from reality

## Key Challenges

- **Ground Truth Problem**: Only users truly know their intentions and authentic identity direction
- **Implicit vs. Explicit Signals**: System currently overweights implicit signals (behavior) vs. explicit feedback
- **Feedback Integration**: How to incorporate user input without completely abandoning algorithmic insights
- **Iterative Refinement**: Current architecture lacks feedback loops for continuous identity model improvement

## Simple Solutions

1. **Identity Steering Controls**
   - Add explicit "direction adjustment" interface where users can:
     - Upvote/downvote identity projections
     - Manually adjust weighting of different data sources
     - Flag misinterpreted signals or false correlations

2. **Identity Narrative Co-authoring**
   - Implement collaborative future-self writing system:
     - AI proposes future narratives based on data
     - User edits, refines, or redirects these narratives
     - System learns from these edits to improve future projections

3. **Feedback-Driven Model Adaptation**
   - Create infrastructure for model improvement through feedback:
     - Log all user corrections and adjustments
     - Regularly retrain models with this feedback data
     - Develop evaluation metrics for feedback incorporation quality

4. **Reality Checks via Microtasks**
   - Implement lightweight validation mechanisms:
     - Occasional "Is this still true about you?" check-ins
     - Growth direction confirmation dialogues
     - Simple alignment surveys (1-2 questions) during regular usage

## Next Steps

1. Design and implement an "Identity Dashboard" interface with explicit feedback controls
2. Develop feedback data storage schema and integration pipeline
3. Create model update procedures that incorporate user corrections
4. Implement lightweight reality-check microtasks throughout the user experience
5. Add this feedback integration to the immediate 0-3 month technical roadmap
