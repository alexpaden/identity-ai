# AI Mirror of Becoming - Main Synthesis

<CODEX>
  <Vision>AI as a co-founder, guiding individuals and communities towards their future potential by making identity evolution a tangible, actionable process.</Vision>

  <Friction>
    - Inertia/Akrasia: Solo founders and individuals struggle with the knowing-doing gap, leading to stagnation despite good ideas.
    - Invisible Growth: Offline development and subtle online shifts are not captured by current systems, leading to incomplete identity views.
    - Fragmented Identity: Digital presence is scattered, making holistic self-understanding and future projection difficult.
    - Generic AI: Current AI optimizes for present engagement, not future potential, and lacks niche community understanding.
  </Friction>

  <Leverage>
    - Rich Digital Traces: Existing data on platforms like Farcaster, GitHub, X, and LinkedIn can be scraped and triangulated for deep identity insights.
    - Temporal Knowledge Graphs: Mapping identity evolution over time to reveal latent trajectories and predict future selves.
    - Community-Specific AI: Fine-tuning models on niche community data to provide authentic, context-aware guidance. (from technical-architecture.md)
    - Contradiction Analysis: Using inconsistencies in behavior/statements as signals for growth and future potential. (from core-philosophy.md & other.md)
  </Leverage>

  <Mechanics>
    - Automated Accountability Loops: Publicly committing to small tasks and facing immediate consequences for inaction (Founder OS concept from business-strategy.md).
    - Precision User Modeling: Using custom evals, SLMs, and dynamic graphs to track subtle behavioral shifts. (from technical-architecture.md)
    - Cross-Platform Synthesis & Triangulation: Combining signals from multiple digital sources to build a coherent identity picture. (from technical-architecture.md)
    - Micro-Transformations: Prompting small, actionable changes based on identified friction points or contradictions. (from other.md & core-philosophy.md)
  </Mechanics>

  <NextMoves>
    - Implement v0 of "Founder OS" `NEXT()`/`GUARD()` loop with GitHub Actions and simple cloud functions for one user.
    - Begin scraping and indexing Farcaster data for a small, defined user set, focusing on "thread-to-profile" embeddings.
    - Draft initial "Sentence Level Frameworks" for summarizing user insights from Farcaster data.
  </NextMoves>

  <Whispers>
    - The "emotional AI" angle is powerful but ethically complex; needs careful framing around user agency and transparency. (from core-philosophy.md & other.md)
    - Integrating "offline growth" (workshops, skills) is key but requires user-driven reporting and verification to avoid gaming. (from technical-architecture.md & other.md)
    - "Micro-simulation sandbox" for testing identity moves is compelling but technically challenging for MVP. (from other.md)
    - The idea of "collective tipping points" in community evolution is a powerful long-term vision. (from other.md)
  </Whispers>

  <RecursiveMultiplier>
    - Review CODEX weekly: Has "Friction" shifted? Are "NextMoves" still relevant or blocked? Did "Whispers" become actionable or irrelevant? What new patterns from `other.md` should be explicitly tested or incorporated?
  </RecursiveMultiplier>

  <OneThingNotIncluded>
    - **System Design Blind Spot**: The current thinking heavily relies on individual user data and AI synthesis. There's less emphasis on the *interface* through which users interact with their "Mirror of Becoming." How do users *see* these insights, *correct* the AI, and *co-author* their future self in a practical, engaging UI/UX? Without this, the system risks being an analytical engine with no accessible steering wheel for the user.
