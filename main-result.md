# Mirror of Becoming: Main Synthesis

<CODEX>
<Vision>
AI evolves from a passive analyzer into an active guide for authentic human potential, using temporal knowledge graphs and community-specific models to help individuals discover and develop their future selves.
</Vision>

<Friction>
- Generic AI models miss community-specific nuances and temporal evolution of identity
- Digital footprints are fragmented across platforms, making holistic identity analysis difficult
- Offline growth and real-world achievements often go untracked
- Current AI systems optimize for present engagement rather than future potential
</Friction>

<Leverage>
- Rich cross-platform data (Farcaster, GitHub, X) enables identity trajectory mapping
- Community-specific language and behavior patterns can train specialized AI models
- Temporal knowledge graphs can capture evolving relationships and competencies
- Token economics ($MIND) can incentivize valuable content and attention direction
</Leverage>

<Mechanics>
- Custom evaluations (Evals) test small language models on specific behaviors
- Dynamic graph databases track user evolution and relationship changes over time
- Synthetic data generation enhances limited datasets for community-specific training
- Cross-platform identity bridges unify fragmented digital footprints
- Zero-knowledge privacy layers enable selective data disclosure
</Mechanics>

<NextMoves>
1. Implement basic temporal knowledge graph for tracking user evolution
2. Deploy community-specific model training pipeline starting with Farcaster data
3. Create prototype of $MIND token mechanics for attention direction
4. Develop offline achievement validation system using event POAPs
</NextMoves>

<Whispers>
- Could AI become not just a mirror but a co-author of identity?
- What if emotional patterns become more valuable than technical skills?
- How might sovereign identity evolve when AI can predict future selves?
- Could community-specific AI models develop their own unique "personalities"?
</Whispers>

<RecursiveMultiplier>
Weekly synthesis should focus more on tracking actual identity transformations rather than just digital activity metrics. Consider adding "Identity Evolution Score" that combines online and offline signals.
</RecursiveMultiplier>

<OneThingNotIncluded>
The system currently lacks a mechanism for handling identity conflicts - when the AI's projected future self contradicts the user's desired direction. This raises ethical questions about AI influence on identity formation.
