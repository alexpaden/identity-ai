# Identity & AI Social Problems for Founders ‚Äì Overview & Scoring

This file presents a standardized approach to evaluating **founder-growth problems** related to identity, influence, and AI in social contexts. It uses a **Potential Value Score (PVS)** formula that merges short-/long-term impact, market relevance, and implementation difficulty. Each item is broken down in Markdown with consistent headings, ensuring concise justifications and an ‚ÄúOptimized Solution.‚Äù

## üèÜ Reward Function: PVS Formula
```
PVS = (Short-Term Impact + Long-Term Impact + Market Relevance) / (Current Difficulty + Optimized Solution Difficulty)
```
- **Short-Term Impact:** 1‚Äì5 scale, from minimal immediate benefit to strong strategic payoff.
- **Long-Term Impact:** 1‚Äì5, representing sustained leverage or compounding value.
- **Market Relevance:** 1‚Äì5, how vital or in-demand the solution is in the founder‚Äôs domain.
- **Current Difficulty:** 1‚Äì5, capturing the complexity of existing processes/solutions.
- **Optimized Solution Difficulty:** 1‚Äì5, reflecting the effort or innovation required to implement an improved approach.

> **Scoring Principle**: Keep values abstract (1‚Äì5) and avoid invented market-sizing. Justify each score briefly in parentheses.
